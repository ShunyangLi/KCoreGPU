# KcoreGPU
Accelerating k-Core Decomposition by a GPU

Compiling the program:
    
    $ cd /KcoreGPU/
    $ make 
    By default, nvcc and g++ compiler is used.
    
    
Execution:
    
    The program can be executed using the following command:
    $ ./kcore graph.txt

Sample Datasets:
    Some datasets are provided in dataset folder, please use them to experiment the execution of our algorithm. e.g. 
    $ ./kcore dataset/amazon0601.txt
